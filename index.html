                        I am a part of two sports clubs in this school.
                        The ultimate frisbee and tennis club.
                        I started playing tennis competitively since I was 8
                        and was able to pick up ultimate frisbee during my first
                        semester at Cal Poly Pomona.

                        The picture below shows one of my first cakes with one of my friends.
                        For some context behind the cake, my best friend and I
                        watched a youtube video, back in 2016, of a really cool fourth of july
                        cake with layers on the inside. So we decided to try and
                        make it. It was supposed to look like the youtube video,
                        but our cake ended up like this. It started a tradition
                        we call <q>Fourth of July Fail Cake</q>, and every year on the
                        fourth of july, we make a cake.
