        I started playing tennis when my sister, who is six years older than me, started playing.
        I began to play competitive matches when I was 8 and continued the tennis journey. For
        Ultimate Frisbee, I started last year and have had a blast ever since. Below is a link to
        an article about the cpp tennis team at nationals last year.
