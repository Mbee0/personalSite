            I started playing tennis when my sister, who is six years older than me, started playing.
            I began to play competitive matches when I was 8 and continued the tennis journey. For 
            Ultimate Frisbee, I started last year and have had a blast ever since. Below is a link to 
            an article about the cpp tennis team at nationals last year.

        <h3>Some of my hobbies outside of class include baking, sleeping, and playing the ukulele.</h3>
