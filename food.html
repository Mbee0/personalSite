            The picture below shows one of my first cakes with one of my friends. 
            For some context behind the cake, my best friend and I 
            watched a youtube video, back in 2016, of a really cool fourth of july 
            cake with layers on the inside. So we decided to try and 
            make it. It was supposed to look like the youtube video, 
            but our cake ended up like this. It started a tradition 
            we call "Fourth of July Fail Cake", and every year on the 
            fourth of july, we make a cake.
